      <h1>Project Alpha</h1>
      <p>The first step to creating an effective project
        plan is to set a baseline. The baseline is the
        foundation on which the other project elements
        will be built. This must include a scope
        statement. Start by identifying what business
        need the project aims to address and how the
        company will benefit Then create milestones as
        appropriate to the size of the project. Next,
        create a work breakdown structure (WBS),
        breaking up large tasks into smaller ones.
        Lastly, come up with a baseline management
        plan which details how stakeholders will review
        and approve changes to the baseline. Outlining
        your vision should always be on a positive note.
        This part allows you to explain the concept you
        have in mind, and how the company can benefit
        from it. Lastly, in setting your goals.
        In stating your mission, vision, and goals, it is
        best to be straightforward and concise. Your
        mission should clearly describe your purpose
        and what you wish to achieve for your company.
        Using keywords is highly crucial in this part as it
        can help summarise your objectives and
        highlight your approach. Not all things you've
        listed in the baseline will be followed to the
        letter as the project moves along. This early,
        plan how you will manage changes to the
        project scope, budget, or schedule with a
        change management plan. This ensures that any
        proposed changes will undergo a systematic
        review and approval process by all involved
        before being implemented. Make sure to define
        who will manage and evaluate the change
        request, as well as an agreed-upon timeframe.
